Mostly walks and sites I like to see / do in Malta. Including how long you should set aside.

## Mdina - (Half day)
- [Mdina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mdina) - (Beautiful views along the wall at night time).
- [Crystal Palace](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g190326-d2291548-Reviews-Crystal_Palace-Rabat_Island_of_Malta.html) awesome place to eat [Pastizz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastizz) try a Pea one and a Ricotta one.
- [Fontanella Tea Garden](https://www.fontanellateagarden.com.mt/home) good cakes and good view of the entire east side of the island of Malta.
 
## Rabat - (half day, right next to Mdina)
- [Rabat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabat,_Malta) -The streets of rabat are very pretty and cool to walk around.
- [St Paul’s Catacombs](https://heritagemalta.mt/explore/st-pauls-catacombs/) - can take  up 2 hours, depends how much you like catacombs.

 
## Gozo - ( take cash as card is not always an option)
- Hike along the ferry south coast to [Mġarr ix-Xini](https://www.visitgozo.com/where-to-go-in-gozo/beaches/mgarr-ix-xini/)
- [Cittadella](https://www.visitgozo.com/where-to-go-in-gozo/sight-seeing-places-of-interest/citadel-cittadella/)
- [Ta Pinu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%27_Pinu) Well worth visiting. Very unique Roman Catholic Shrine
- [Ta' Għammar Hill](https://www.visitgozo.com/blog/passions-and-pilgrimages-why-you-must-experience-gozo-during-easter/) Outside of Ta Pinu there is a short hike that shows the easter story with statues, that takes 20 minutes. Walk over the chain as its to stop bikes not people walking.
- [Xlendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xlendi) popular seaside destination known for its dramatic cliffs, crystal-clear waters, and quaint charm
